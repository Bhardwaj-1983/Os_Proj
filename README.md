Operating Systems-316 Project 
### 1. **Project Overview:**

The **Secure File Management System (SFMS)** is designed to manage files in a way that ensures their confidentiality, integrity, and access control. The primary goals of the system are:

- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users should be able to access the files.
- **Integrity**: Files should not be altered without authorization.
- **Access Control**: Implement permissions and roles to control who can access or modify files.

The system should be easy to use for both personal and business use, allowing users to:

- Securely store and organize files.
- Share files with others while maintaining control over who has access.
- Ensure files are protected against unauthorized access, loss, and tampering.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A secure system where files are protected by encryption and access control mechanisms.
- A user-friendly interface for file management and sharing.
- A robust backend to manage file storage, encryption, and permissions.

**Scope:** The system will include:

- User authentication and authorization.
- File upload, download, and sharing with encryption.
- File versioning and backup mechanisms.
- Logging of access attempts and activities for audit purposes.

### 2. **Module-Wise Breakdown:**

#### **Module 1: User Interface (UI)**

**Purpose**: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly front-end for managing and interacting with files. **Roles**:

- Allow users to upload, view, download, and share files.
- Provide options to manage file access permissions.
- Display alerts and messages regarding file status (e.g., successful upload, encryption, etc.).

**Functionalities**:

- **File Upload**: Allow users to select files for upload.
- **File Listing**: Display a list of uploaded files with details (size, name, access permissions).
- **Access Control**: Allow users to set access permissions (who can view/edit files).
- **Notification System**: Alerts for successful or failed actions.
- **Login/Logout**: Authentication system for secure user login.

#### **Module 2: Security & Encryption**

**Purpose**: Ensure file confidentiality, integrity, and prevent unauthorized access. **Roles**:

- Encrypt files before storage and decryption when downloaded.
- Maintain file integrity using hashing techniques.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for file access.

**Functionalities**:

- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files before storing them to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Hashing**: Store hash values for files to detect tampering.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Control who can access and modify files.
- **Secure File Sharing**: Allow users to share encrypted files while retaining control over permissions.

#### **Module 3: Backend & Storage**

**Purpose**: Handle file storage, versioning, and retrieval, along with user management. **Roles**:

- Store files securely and efficiently.
- Handle file versioning to maintain file history.
- Manage user authentication and authorization.
- Maintain audit logs for security purposes.

**Functionalities**:

- **File Storage**: Store encrypted files on the server or cloud.
- **File Retrieval**: Retrieve and decrypt files upon request.
- **Version Control**: Maintain previous versions of files for rollback.
- **Audit Logs**: Record actions taken on files (who accessed/modified them).
- **User Management**: Admin can add/remove users and set permissions.

---

### 3. **Functionalities**:

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the functionalities for each module:

#### **Module 1: User Interface (UI)**

- **File Uploading**: Upload files to the system.
- **File Sharing**: Share files with specified users (via email or a link).
- **File Listing and Management**: Users can view files, and check permissions, and status.
- **Permissions**: Set access permissions for files (read, write, delete).
- **Notifications**: Real-time alerts for successful or failed operations.

#### **Module 2: Security & Encryption**

- **File Encryption (AES or RSA)**: Encrypt files during upload and decrypt them on download.
- **Hashing (SHA-256)**: Generate a hash for each file to detect unauthorized modifications.
- **Access Control (RBAC)**: Set roles such as admin, user, and guest for granular file access permissions.
- **Audit Logs**: Record all file access, modifications, and permission changes.

#### **Module 3: Backend & Storage**

- **File Storage (SQL/NoSQL Database)**: Store encrypted files and metadata in a structured format.
- **File Retrieval**: Retrieve and decrypt files when requested by authorized users.
- **Version Control**: Track multiple versions of the same file and allow rollback.
- **User Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication for added security.

### 4. **Technology Recommendations**:

- **Programming Languages**:
    
    - **Frontend**: JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js for building the user interface)
    - **Backend**: Python (Flask/Django for the server-side implementation), or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Libraries and Tools**:
    
    - **Encryption**: `PyCryptodome` for Python (AES, RSA encryption), `CryptoJS` for JavaScript (AES).
    - **Hashing**: `hashlib` in Python (SHA-256), `CryptoJS` for hashing in JavaScript.
    - **Database**:
        - **SQL**: PostgreSQL or MySQL for relational storage.
        - **NoSQL**: MongoDB if you need flexibility for storing unstructured data.
    - **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.
    - **File Upload/Download**: `AWS S3` or similar cloud storage services for file storage.
    - **Version Control**: Git-like functionality for file versioning.
- **Tools**:
    
    - **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code (VSCode), PyCharm for Python.
    - **Version Control**: Git for managing source code.
    - **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, AWS or Heroku for deployment.

### 5. **Execution Plan**:

#### **Step 1: Design the Database and File Storage Structure**

- Define how files will be stored (encrypted) in the database or cloud storage.
- Design the schema for user management and file metadata.

#### **Step 2: Implement User Authentication**

- Set up user registration, login, and multi-factor authentication.
- Define roles for access control (e.g., admin, user, guest).

#### **Step 3: Develop the File Upload/Download System**

- Create the file upload and download functionality.
- Implement file encryption before upload and decryption before download.

#### **Step 4: Implement Access Control**

- Implement the role-based access control (RBAC) system.
- Ensure files can only be accessed by authorized users.

#### **Step 5: Add File Versioning and Backup**

- Implement version control so users can view and roll back to previous versions of a file.

#### **Step 6: Implement Audit Logs**

- Develop a system to log file access, modifications, and permission changes for auditing purposes.

#### **Step 7: User Interface Development**

- Create the user interface using React or Vue.js to interact with the backend.
